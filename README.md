This repository provides data and Python notebooks required to reproduce the results of the paper **Experimental preparation of multiphoton-added coherent states of light** by Jiří Fadrný, Michal Neset, Martin Bielak, Jan Bílek, Miroslav Ježek, and Jaromír Fiurášek, [npj Quantum Information 10, 89 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-024-00885-y).

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure2.ipynb" contains the definition of a function computing the Wigner function of the quantum state and plotting it. The quantum states plotted in Figure 2 of the publication are stored in the "Density_matrixes" folder.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure3.ipynb" contains the definition of functions necessary to visualize density matrixes of the presented quantum states. The quantum states plotted in Figure 3 of the publication are stored in the "Density_matrixes" folder.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure4.ipynb" contains the definition of functions required to reproduce Figure 4 of the publication. The datapoints corresponding to experimentally observed values of the amplification gain and quadrature variances are stored in the "Data_points" folder.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure5.ipynb" contains the definition of functions required to reproduce Figure 5 of the publication. The datapoints corresponding to experimentally observed values of the fidelity of amplified states with coherent states are stored in the "Data_points" folder.

The Jupyter notebook "Git_Figure6.ipynb" contains the code and necessary to reproduce Figure 6 of the publication. The supporting files are stored in the "Density_matrixes" and "Data_points" folders.
